Questions :

1) Should we use input or button for reset and submit purposes?
we can use any tag, but its type is very important
e.g. <input type="submit" />				correct
	 <button type="reset">Reset</button>	correct
2) value attribute of button does not work
because its syntax is different from input
3) can we define variables in html css
yes
4) can we drop label tag, and name labels directly?
no lable has many advantages, use Label 


Concepts :

1) variable names : camelCase  (JS)
2) function names : camelCase() ,with brackets
3) constant Literals : UPPER_CASE (JS)
4) objects : CapitalLetter = {}; (JS)

html/css: class/variable names : name-secondname , seperated by -

Learnings : 

1) Always close preclosed tags like <input />, <br /> etc.
2) 'type' in button is very important to mention, reset type does reset function, submit type submits the form.
3) label is important beacause it gives extra active area for the user, to make interaction easy
	label 'for' attribute refers to the input element with the use of input element's id attribute
	i.e. label.for = input.id;
4) use the script  tag in the end
